Before you get started by watching the tutorial video below, take note that the social media section appears first in the HTML.  Normally you write the HTML in the order by which it will display left to right on a website but with a mobile, responsive website you style the HTML that you want to appear first at the mobile width. In our case the column appearing on the right will be coded first and we’ll get it on the right of the website using a CSS style! See how with the video and enjoy!
